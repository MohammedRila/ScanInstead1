Create a complete full-stack app called **ScanInstead** using Node.js and Express. The app replaces door-to-door knocking with a QR-based digital pitch system.

🎯 Core Features:
1. Homeowner visits `/create` with their name and email, gets a unique QR code and URL.
2. QR links to a mobile-friendly `/v/:id` pitch form.
3. Visitors fill:
   - Full name (required)
   - Company (optional)
   - Offer (required, text or dropdown)
   - Reason (required, paragraph)
   - Optional file upload (image or PDF)
   - Email & phone (optional but encouraged)
4. Submissions:
   - Stored in Firebase Firestore under `submissions/{id}`
   - Emailed to the homeowner using Nodemailer
   - Optional: logs an SMS via Twilio (SMS disabled by default)

🧠 Tech Stack:
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Frontend: Plain HTML + Tailwind CSS (dark/light toggle UI)
- Database: Firebase Firestore via `firebase-admin`
- File Upload: Multer (uploads saved in `/public/uploads`)
- Email: Nodemailer (Gmail SMTP with App Password)
- QR Code: `qrcode` NPM package
- SMS (Optional): Twilio SDK (disabled unless `TWILIO_ENABLED=true`)
- Environment Config: `.env`
- UUID: Use `uuid` to generate unique homeowner IDs

📁 Folder Structure:
- `index.js` — main server
- `sms.js` — Twilio helper (respects enable flag)
- `/public/pitch.html` — mobile pitch form
- `/public/uploads` — store uploaded flyers
- `start.bat` — optional: Windows setup script
- `.env.example` — environment var template

📄 .env variables required:
- FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON={...}
- EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
- EMAIL_PASS=your_gmail_app_password
- TWILIO_ENABLED=false
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=
- TWILIO_PHONE=

⚙️ Behavior:
- When a visitor submits the form:
  - Store pitch data in Firebase
  - Email homeowner a structured HTML pitch
  - Optionally send Twilio SMS (mocked if disabled)

🧪 Add confirmation messages after submit:
- “Thanks! The homeowner has received your message. Please do not knock unless requested.”

✅ Requirements:
- Fully working in Replit
- All dependencies installed
- Secrets via `.env`
- Runs with `node index.js`
- Optionally include `start.bat` file for offline Windows use

Generate all necessary files and setup.
